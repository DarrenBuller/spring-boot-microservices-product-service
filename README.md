# Spring Boot Microservices
This repo follows the excellent Spring Boot Microservices Tutorial tutorial by Sai following his [youtube videos](https://youtu.be/yn_stY3HCr8?si=HAiHvepgS2GoAS30), [blog](https://programmingtechie.com/) while trying not to reference his [github repo](https://github.com/SaiUpadhyayula/spring-boot-3-microservices-course?tab=readme-ov-file)

Rather than fork the original this repo implements each chapter as a commit so that it's clear on the changes required to add each stage of functionality. The code was developed using vscode and utilises a devcontainer with host networking to allow the services to interact. This repo implements the 'Product Service' from the original tutorial
